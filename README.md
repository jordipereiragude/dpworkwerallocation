# Dynamic Programming code for the Worker Allocation Problem

Source code for ``A note on Algorithms for the Calzedonia workload allocation problem''

The code depends on the boost library and requires a "recent" c++ compiler (the makefile uses c++11 flag).

Tested in linux (gcc 9.3.0) and macos (clang 11.0.3).
